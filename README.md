# G^4

## "Created" by u130da and FerriVer


### I think we can all agree that **Go Guardian sucks**. G⁴ is here to fix that. G⁴ is an easy and effective alternative to paying attention


> ***U130da and FerriVer are not responsible for any misuse of this exploit***
>> G⁴ stands for "Good Game Go Gardian" (I know it doesn't make sense math-wise, but I thought it sounded cool so whatever)

# Setup steps:


```
Step one, open the tool tray that looks like this (it may be horizontal for you):

```
Step two, open the wifi settings panel by clicking the drop down (the tiny arrow):

```

```

```
Step four, click the gear icon:

```
Step five, scroll down and click the “proxy” button:

```
Step six, allow proxies for shared networks, a pop up will appear on your screen, 
just click allow and continue: 		
```

```
Step seven, change the proxy connection type to Manual proxy configuration and turn on Use the same 
proxy for all protocols. Type 0.0.0.0 into the Proxy input box and make sure the Port input box says 80.
```

```
Step eight is a little tough, you’re going to need to go to “this” link. There, you’ll find a list of websites we’ve 
painstakingly unblocked. Paste this list into the "Do not use the proxy settings for these hosts and domains" input box.
```
```
Step nine is extreamly important. Once this is all running and you're ready to use it, hit the question mark key 
and the escape [esc] key at the same time. Doing this will bring up the Task Manager. Just click on go gardian and 
hit "End Task". You did it. You're now free to do what ever you want.
```

```
If you would like to turn G⁴ off, just switch back to any other wifi. These setting will only affect "Trojan Guest".
```

```
